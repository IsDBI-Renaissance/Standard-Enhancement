Changes Made:

* **Clarity:** Rephrased sentences for better flow and understanding, particularly in the introduction and definitions.  Replaced vague terms like "marked-up price" with more precise language.
* **Consistency:**  Replaced "Islamic financial institution" with the consistent abbreviation "IFI" throughout.
* **Precision:**  Specified that the markup in Murabaha is *pre-determined*. Clarified the accounting treatment by mentioning profit recognition over the payment period.  Improved wording in prohibited practices to avoid ambiguity.
* **Readability:** Improved sentence structure and paragraphing for better flow. Used bullet points effectively in lists.  Maintained a consistent and professional tone.  Removed redundancy between the main body and the definitions section.


The revised JSON provides a clearer, more precise, and consistent representation of the AAOIFI Murabaha standard.
