AAOIFI Standard on Murabaha Transactions

Introduction

Murabaha is a prevalent Islamic finance transaction where an Islamic financial institution procures an asset and subsequently sells it to a client at a price that includes a profit margin. The payment for this can be deferred. The aim of this standard is to elucidate the Shariah prerequisites for valid Murabaha transactions.

Scope

This standard is applicable to Islamic financial institutions that provide Murabaha financing products. It delves into the fundamental structure, requirements, and prohibitions associated with Murabaha transactions.

Definitions

Murabaha: A sale contract wherein the seller openly states the cost of the commodity being sold and sells it to another party by including a profit margin in the cost.

Commodity: Any asset, tangible or intangible, that can be possessed and sold.

Promise (Wa'd): A one-sided commitment made by one party to execute a specific action in the future.

Shariah Requirements

Basic Requirements

1. The Islamic financial institution must possess actual ownership of the asset before selling it to the client.
2. The asset must be in the physical or constructive possession of the Islamic financial institution prior to its sale.
3. The sale contract must be executed subsequent to the Islamic financial institution's acquisition of the asset.
4. The cost price and the profit margin must be clearly disclosed to the client.
5. The asset must comply with Shariah principles.

Prohibited Practices

1. Selling the asset without acquiring rightful ownership and possession.
