# AAOIFI Standard on Murabaha

## Introduction

Murabaha is a common Islamic finance transaction where an Islamic financial institution purchases an asset and then sells it to a customer at a marked-up price, with payment deferred. This standard provides guidance on the Shariah requirements for valid Murabaha transactions.

## Scope

This standard applies to Islamic financial institutions that offer Murabaha financing products. It covers the basic structure, requirements, and prohibitions related to Murabaha transactions.

## Definitions

Murabaha: A sale contract where the seller explicitly declares the cost of the sold commodity and sells it to another party by adding a markup in the cost.

Commodity: Any tangible or intangible asset that can be owned and sold.

Promise (Wa'd): A unilateral commitment made by one party to another to perform a certain action in the future.

## Shariah Requirements

### Basic Requirements

1. The Islamic financial institution must actually own the asset before selling it to the customer.
2. The asset must be in the physical or constructive possession of the Islamic financial institution before selling it.
3. The sale contract must be executed after the Islamic financial institution acquires the asset.
4. The cost price and the markup must be clearly disclosed to the customer.
5. The asset must be Shariah-compliant.

### Prohibited Practices

1. Selling the asset before acquiring ownership and possession.
2. Charging late payment fees that accrue as income to the Islamic financial institution.
3. Rollover of debt into a new Murabaha transaction.
4. Using interest-based benchmarks without ensuring that the transaction structure is Shariah-compliant.

## Accounting Treatment

The Islamic financial institution should record:
1. The purchase of the asset as inventory.
2. The sale of the asset as a receivable.
3. The markup as deferred profit.

## Examples

### Example 1: Home Financing
An Islamic bank purchases a house for $200,000 and sells it to the customer for $250,000 to be paid over 10 years.

### Example 2: Working Capital Financing
An Islamic bank purchases inventory for a business at a cost of $100,000 and sells it to the business for $110,000 to be paid in 6 months.

## Effective Date

This standard is effective from January 1, 2023.
